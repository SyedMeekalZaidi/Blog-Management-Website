This website was developed with the following stack and guidelines

Front/Back-End: TypeScript <br>
CSS: SASS <br>
HTML: Semantic <br>

The project is structured to follow single responsibility princples, and global design variables are made to adhere to DRY princples.

Main approach of the app:

- <b>usePosts</b>: retrieves the data from the Mock API
- <b>PostList</b>: renders the list of posts
- <b>PostDetails</b>: a mock detail page for each Page
- <b>Filter</b>: renders the filter options and the self description pages
- <b>App</b>: brings all components together to create the website

The application highlights my skills in frontend development, including efficient data fetching, TypeScript type safety, and a clean, user-friendly interface.

Thnak you,
Meekal
