This website was developed with the following stack and guidelines

Front/Back-End: TypeScript <br>
CSS: SASS <br>
HTML: Semantic <br>

The project is structured to follow single responsibility princples, and global design variables are made to adhere to DRY princples.

Main approach of the app:

- <b>usePosts</b>: retrieves the data from the Mock API
- <b>PostList</b>: renders the list of posts
- <b>PostDetails</b>: a mock detail page for each Page
- <b>Filter</b>: renders the filter options and the self description pages
- <b>App</b>: brings all components together to create the website

<b>All of the following requirements are implemented. üòÅ </b>

### Requirements

These are the minimum requirements for the exercies:

1. Retrieve the data from the mock API.
1. Output the data in a list, including properties from the data that are appropriate for a list view.
1. Implement a category filter - this can be single or multi-select.
1. Implement pagination - this can be traditional numbered pages or "load more".
1. Use semantic markup where possible.
1. Create a responsive layout with HTML and CSS.

### Additional Exercises

If you have time then demonstrating any of the following would be considered as a bonus:

1. Use client-side routing to create a "detail" page.
1. Persist filter state in the query string.
1. Include animated transitions between application state, e.g. when filtering.
1. Convert the application to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
1. Use a CSS preprocessor or CSS-in-JS rather than plain CSS.
